# CS 102 Project : Multifunctional Fitness App
This mobile app is for people who want to plan their fitness schedules and for facility owners who want to manage their facilities and their schedule. 
With this app, you will be able to manage your fitness schedule by specifying unavailable hours for you, make an appointment from a registered facility of your choice
and find a fitness buddy who will help you throughout your appointment period. If you are a facility owner, you will be able to manage the quota of your facility for
different time periods.
